Simply add a new file to the _posts-directory and name it yyyy-MM-dd-title-of-page.md. Prefix the content of the file with a header.
The header for this page looks like this:

```

layout: page
title:  Add new post

category: doc
order: 2

```  

* `layout` - Should always be `page`.
* `title` - Page title, preferably the same as the title in the file name, but doesn't have to be.
* `date` - Date and timestamp of file creation using format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`
* `category` - Short code corresponding to `sections` in `_config.yml`-file.
* `order` - What order the page should appear as link in the left side navigation bar for the category. First post is `0`.

The header title will be appended to the top of the rendered post.
